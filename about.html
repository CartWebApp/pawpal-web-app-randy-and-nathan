                <p>Welcome to Wellnesti — a small project built with big heart by Nate and Randy.
                     We created Wellnesti because we believe caring for pets should be as fun, rewarding, and intuitive as caring for one of those classic digital companions we all grew up with. 
                     Our goal was simple: to combine the nostalgia of a Tamagotchi with the practicality of a modern pet wellness tracker, helping owners stay connected, organized, and mindful about their pets’ health and happiness. 
                     What started as a creative idea between two classmates quickly grew into a shared passion for making pet care feel less like a checklist and more like a daily act of love. 
                     Every feature, from the playful interface to the gentle reminders, was designed to bring warmth and ease into the routines that keep our pets thriving. 
                     At Wellnesti, we’re not just building an app — we’re building a cozy digital space where wellness meets companionship. 
                     Thanks for being part of the journey — your pets deserve the best, and we’re here to help you give it to them. 
                    Thank you for trusting us!<p>
