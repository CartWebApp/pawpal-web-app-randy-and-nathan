                <p>At Wellnesti, we care about your privacy as much as you care about your pets. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and protect your information when you use our app and website. When you create an account or use Wellnesti, we may collect basic details such as your name, email, and information about your pets, along with app usage data that helps us improve performance and user experience. We use this information solely to operate and enhance our services, personalize your experience, and send important updates related to your account. We do not sell, rent, or trade your personal information to anyone, and we only share data with trusted service providers who help us maintain the app or meet legal requirements if necessary. Your information is stored securely using modern encryption and access controls, and while no system is completely immune to breaches, we take every reasonable measure to keep your data safe. You have the right to access, correct, or request deletion of your personal information at any time by contacting us at [your contact email]. Wellnesti is designed for users aged 13 and older, and we do not knowingly collect personal information from children under that age. From time to time, we may update this policy to reflect improvements or changes in regulations, and the latest version will always be available on our website. By using Wellnesti, you trust us with your data, and we take that trust seriously â€” protecting it is part of our promise to help both you and your pets thrive.</p>
